# Personal Website

This is my website/blog. It's definitely not finished yet, but it does the job.

## Todo

- [x] Social Media
- [x] Blog Functionality
- [x] Markdown Support
- [ ] CI
- [ ] Blog Back-End (rather than hard-coding the posts)
- [ ] Authentication, with a little form behind it to submit a new post
- [ ] SSR for SEO
- [ ] Routing for blog posts
- [ ] Better styling
- [ ] Feels flashy

## Usage

```bash

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm dev` or `pnpm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `pnpm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
